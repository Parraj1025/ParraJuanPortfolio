# Mock Up
```html
    @media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
    .nav {  
      flex-direction: column;
    }

    .aside {
        background-color: blue;
    }
}
```
this part of the code allows elements to change when the window on which the site is running varies.

```html
 <head>
        <title>Juan Parra</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> <meta>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style/style.css">
    </head>
```
this is how the page is linked to the style sheet css file

```html
 <nav>
            <div class="nav">
                <a href="#about-me"> About Me</a>
                <a href="#projects"> Projects</a>
                <a href="#aside"> Contact Me</a>
                <a href="./assets/Documents/ParraJuanResume.pdf"> Resume</a>
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-parra-01a4a0113/"> Linked-In</a>
            </div>
    </nav>
``` 
last item in this section allows you to navigate to my linkedin from my site.

```html
 <div class="projects" id="projects">
                    <h2> Previous Projects</h2>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://parraj1025.github.io/Horisean-Project-Complete/" target="https://parraj1025.github.io/Horisean-Project-Complete/">
                            <img src="./assets/images/mockup.png">
                        </a>
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            Role: Develop companies website to include a semantic HTML structure and improving the sites accessibility
                        </ul>
                     </div>
                     ```
this is how i was able to link my previous project to the picture displayed in my "projects" section of the page.
